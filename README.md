# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project uses linear regression to predict salaries based on years of experience. It demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent, cost function optimization, and data visualization techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of employee salaries and their corresponding years of experience.
